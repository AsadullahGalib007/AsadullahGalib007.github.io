I am excited to announce that I have earned a new certification from QWorld by successfully completing the Graduate Level 3 ECTS QCourse 501-2, achieving a grade of 96 out of 100. Throughout the course, I brushed up my knowledge in Python programming, mathematics, quantum mechanics, and the fundamentals of quantum computing. During the self-study module, I learned about the principles of Quantum Key Distribution, including classical-quantum cryptography, BB84, and BB92 protocols.
