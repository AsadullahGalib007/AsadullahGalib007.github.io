## World University of Bangladesh
*July 2025 – Present*

Currently serving as a Lecturer of Computer Science and Engineering at World University of Bangladesh, where I teach undergraduate courses and mentor students in their academic and research endeavors.

### Key Teaching Approaches:
- Implementation of OBE (Outcome-Based Education) curriculum principles
- Application of Bloom's taxonomy in course design and assessment
- Development of comprehensive course materials and practical assignments
- Student mentorship and guidance in academic projects

## Current Courses:

### 1. Computer Fundamentals
- **Level**: Undergraduate
- **Description**: Introduction to fundamental concepts of computer science and information technology. Topics include computer hardware and software components, number systems, data representation, basic algorithms, and introduction to programming concepts. The course provides students with essential knowledge about how computers work and their applications in various fields.

### 2. C Programming
- **Level**: Undergraduate  
- **Description**: Comprehensive introduction to programming using the C language. Topics covered include basic syntax, data types, control structures, functions, arrays, pointers, strings, and file handling. Students gain hands-on experience through practical programming exercises and projects that build problem-solving skills and programming proficiency.
