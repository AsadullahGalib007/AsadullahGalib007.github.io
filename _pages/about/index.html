Though I don’t have a formal physics background, I’ve eagerly bridged that gap through self-directed learning and immersive experiences. I’ve thrived in challenging environments like the Womanium Quantum + AI program, where I was honored to be a program finalist and a QSL fellowship nominee, and the IBM Quantum Challenge 2024, where I proudly achieved an 11th global ranking. These opportunities, along with hackathons at MIT and contributions to open-source projects, have allowed me to build practical skills and a deep appreciation for quantum problem-solving. My commitment to this field is ongoing as I continue to deepen my knowledge in advanced quantum algorithms, optimizations, and QKD. Now, I’m actively seeking to channel this dedication into a second Master’s or a PhD program, with the goal of contributing to research in Quantum Optimization and Quantum Machine Learning.</p> <p><strong>Research Interests:</strong> Image Processing, Machine Learning, Quantum Optimizations, Quantum Machine Learning(QML), Quantum Key Distribution(QKD).
