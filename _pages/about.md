I'm Asadullah Bin Rahman, a passionate researcher and educator specializing in quantum computing and machine learning. Currently serving as a Lecturer of Computer Science and Engineering at World University of Bangladesh, I explore the intersection of quantum algorithms and artificial intelligence to solve complex computational problems.

My research spans quantum machine learning, medical image processing, and computer vision, with published work on brain tumor classification and MRI image denoising. I'm proficient in quantum computing frameworks like Qiskit, Cirq, and PennyLane, developing hybrid quantum-classical models for classification and anomaly detection.

As an active contributor to the quantum computing community, I've achieved notable recognition including ranking 11th globally in IBM Quantum Challenge 2024, winning at MIT iQuHACK 2025, and being selected as a Womanium Quantum + AI program finalist. I hold advanced certifications in quantum algorithms and maintain a strong competitive programming background. Beyond research, I'm passionate about advancing quantum education and bridging the gap between theoretical concepts and practical applications.

**Research Interests:** Image Processing, Machine Learning, Quantum Computing.
