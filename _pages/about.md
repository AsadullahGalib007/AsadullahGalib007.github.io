As a Computer Science graduate now completing my Master's, I've found my passion at the intersection of AI and the quantum realm. Though I don't have a formal physics background, I've eagerly bridged that gap through self-directed learning and immersive experiences. I've thrived in challenging environments like the Womanium Quantum + AI program, where I was honored to be a program finalist and a QSL fellowship nominee, and the IBM Quantum Challenge 2024, where I proudly achieved an 11th global ranking. These opportunities, along with hackathons at MIT and contributions to open-source projects, have allowed me to build practical skills and a deep appreciation for quantum problem-solving. My commitment to this field is ongoing as I continue to deepen my knowledge in advanced quantum algorithms, optimizations, and QKD. Now, I'm actively seeking to channel this dedication into a second Masterâ€™s or a PhD program, with the goal of contributing to research in Quantum Optimization and Quantum Machine Learning.

**Research Interests:** Image Processing, Machine Learning, Quantum Optimizations, Quantum Machine Learning(QML), Quantum Key Distribution(QKD). You can read my research statement [here](assets/pdf/Asadullah_Research_Statement.pdf).
